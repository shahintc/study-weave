Study Weave

Artifact Comparator & Human Study Platform

Study Weave is a full-stack web application developed for the CS 319 – Object-Oriented Software Engineering course. It enables researchers to conduct systematic, unbiased human-subject studies comparing software engineering artifacts generated by humans and AI (LLMs).

🛠️ Individual Contributions

As a core developer, I architected and implemented critical full-stack modules designed to meet the rigorous requirements of human-subject research. My contributions spanned the entire software development lifecycle.

🔬 Core Research & Evaluation Features

Study Creation Wizard
Designed and implemented a multi-step UI and backend logic enabling researchers to configure complex studies seamlessly.

Blinded Evaluation Module
Developed the core functionality to conceal artifact authorship, preventing participant bias during evaluations.

Artifact Assignment Logic
Built mechanisms to link specific artifacts to studies and manage participant selection criteria.

🎨 Full-Stack Development & UI/UX

Admin & Reviewer Dashboards
Created comprehensive management interfaces with advanced hide and filter functionality for large datasets.

Authentication System
Developed the initial secure login and registration UI, establishing the project’s access foundation.

Notification System
Implemented automated triggers to notify researchers and participants of deadlines, updates, and study progress.

📊 Analytics, Export & Quality Assurance

Data Analytics & Export
Implemented study analytics dashboards and an export engine to generate PDF/PNG results for offline analysis.

Integration Testing
Developed automated integration tests to ensure system stability throughout the development lifecycle.

Bug Resolution & Maintenance
Actively maintained system health by identifying and resolving UI layout issues and researcher-page bugs.
