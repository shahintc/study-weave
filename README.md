🛠️ My Individual Contributions
As a core developer, I architected and implemented critical full-stack modules to meet the rigorous requirements of human-subject research. My work spanned the entire software development lifecycle:

Core Research & Evaluation Features
Study Creation Wizard: Designed and implemented a multi-step UI and backend logic to allow researchers to configure complex studies seamlessly.

Blinded Evaluation Module: Developed the core functionality to hide artifact authorship, preventing participant bias during studies.

Artifact Assignment Logic: Built the system for linking specific artifacts to studies and managing participant selection criteria.

Full-Stack Development & UI/UX
Admin & Reviewer Dashboards: Created comprehensive management interfaces with "hide and filter" functionality for large datasets.

Authentication System: Developed the initial secure login and registration UI, establishing the project's access foundation.

Notification System: Built automated triggers to notify both researchers and participants of deadlines and updates.

Analytics, Export & QA
Data Analytics & Export: Implemented study analytics and an engine to export results as PDF/PNG for offline analysis.

Integration Testing: Developed automated integration tests to ensure system stability throughout the development lifecycle.

Bug Resolution: Actively maintained system health by identifying and resolving bugs in the researcher page and UI layouts.

📝 Description
Study Weave is a web application designed for the CS 319 Object-Oriented Software Engineering course. It provides a platform for researchers to conduct systematic human-subject studies comparing software engineering artifacts (source code, test cases, UML diagrams) generated by both humans and AI (LLMs).

The system uses React.js for a dynamic frontend and Node.js for the backend, demonstrating practical skills in OOD, full-stack development, and collaborative project management.

💡 Key Features
1. Effortless Study Management
Researchers use a powerful dashboard to configure studies, organize artifacts with tags, and create custom competency quizzes for participants.

2. Interactive Evaluation Environment
A side-by-side comparison interface with synchronized scrolling and a "blinded mode" ensures unbiased, high-quality feedback.

3. Actionable Analytics
Real-time dashboards visualize study progress and participant completion rates, with full data export capabilities for deeper research.

🚀 Extra Features
Guest User Role: Broadens study access by allowing non-registered users to participate via secure, shareable links.

Engagement Gamification: Motivates participants with points and badges for timely, high-quality feedback.
